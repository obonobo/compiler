# Stdlib

This directory contains extra assembly files that should always be linked with
all programs built from this compiler. This is sort of the standard library and
any intrinsics/builtins for the compiler, though our language has no imports, so
everything in the standard library should always be included when our programs
are run.

Mainly these are just libraries that were included with the moon handout, so
credit goes to Peter Grogono.
